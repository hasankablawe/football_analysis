# Football Analysis Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in a video using YOLO, one of the best AI object detection models available. We will also train the model to improve its performance. Additionally, we will assign players to teams based on the colors of their t-shirts using Kmeans for pixel segmentation and clustering. With this information, we can measure a team's ball acquisition percentage in a match. This project covers various concepts and addresses real-world problems, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.


## Modules Used
The following modules are used in this project:
- YOLO: AI object detection model
- Kmeans: Pixel segmentation and clustering to detect t-shirt color
- Optical Flow: Measure camera movement
- Perspective Transformation: Represent scene depth and perspective
- Speed and distance calculation per player
